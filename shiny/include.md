# Data Canvas Sensor Log

I am taking part in [Data Canvas: Sense Your City](http://datacanvas.org/sense-your-city/), a project to build a network of 100 sensor nodes in seven cities around the world: San Francisco, Boston, Rio de Janeiro, Geneva, Bangalore, Singapore and Shanghai.

This app displays the output from my sensor node. (The data is in a large file, so please be patient while it loads!)

See [here](http://datacanvas.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Data-Canvas-Sense-Your-City-Node-instructions.pdf) and [here](http://vimeo.com/116127882) for details on the sensors and the node assembly. Code for this app is on [GitHub](https://github.com/paldhous/datacanvas-sensorlog).
